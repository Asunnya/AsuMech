// Per-run randomization for Undead Deathmatch.
//
// Measured from five pulls of one log. Two 6y towers take four players each, on the north/south or
// west/east axis; each tower's group is then leashed to a bat that spawns on it. During each
// Sanguine Scratch both bats sweep 180° around the 12y rim together (15.1°/s), and the group follows
// its bat; each bat then goes off as a circle or a donut where it stops. Random per cycle in the log:
// the cone set that opens, the sweep direction, and which bat is the circle.
//
// A leash stretched past ~10y (the log's long-tether flips land at 10.1-13.3y) turns long and sets
// off Explosion on its player right away and every 3s while it stays long, with Damage Down; the
// log's hits run up to 60% of max HP. That a longer leash hits harder is the players' account, not
// something the log can separate from mitigation, so the scaling past 10y is this sim's guess.
//
// Toxic / Hector: G1 takes the north (or west) tower, G2 the south (or east).
